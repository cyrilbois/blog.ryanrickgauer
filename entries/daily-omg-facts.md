At the start of the new year, I got myself a boxed daily calendar that has "crazy, hard to believe" facts for each entry. So here they are:

* **1-11-22** &mdash; Light doesn't always travel at the speed of light (SOL). SOL is only constant in a vacuum. When it passes through matter it can slow down. Photons pass through water at 3/4ths the regular speed of light. Light was once slowed down to 38mph.
* **1-12-22** &mdash; The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves per side in a game of chess is 318,979,564,000.
