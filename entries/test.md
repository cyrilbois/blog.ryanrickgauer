# Inventory Management
## Managing Inventory
### Four inventory types

| Type | Description |
| ------ | --- |
| **raw material** | inventory that has been purchased, but not processed |
| **work in progress** | components that have undergone some change but not yet completed |
| **MRO** | inventories devoted to maintenance/repair/operating supplies necessary to keep machinery and processes productive |
| **finished goods** | completed product awaiting shipment |

### ABC Analysis
* **ABC analysis** &mdash; classifies inventory items based on the item's consumption values
* based on the *Pareto principle* 
* **annual dollar volume** = *annual demand* &times; *cost per unit*
* **Class A** represent only 15% of total inventory items, they represent 70%-80% of total dollar usage
* **Class B** represents 30% inventory items, 15%-25% annual dollar value
* **Class C** represents 55% inventory items, 5% annual dollar volume

### Cycle Counting
* **cycle counting** &mdash; inventory items are verified a different number of times based on their ABC anyalysis classification
* Class A items are counted frequently (monthly)
* Class B items are counted less frequently (quarterly)
* Class C items are counted (every 6 months)
* advantages of cycle counting:
  * eliminates the shutdown and interruption of production
  * eliminates annual inventory adjustments
  * trained personnel audit the accuracy of the inventory
  * allows the cause of the errors to be identified and remedial action to be taken
  * maintains accurate inventory records

## Inventory Models
* **independent demand** &mdash; demand for item is free from outside control of the demand for any other item in inventory
* **dependent demand** &mdash; demand for item is determined by a demand for some other item in the inventory

### Holding, Ordering, and Setup Costs

* **holding costs** &mdash; costs associated with holding/carrying inventory over time
* **ordering costs** &mdash; costs of supplies, forms, order processing, purchasing, clerical support
* **setup costs** &mdash; the cost to prepare a machine or process for manufacturing an order
  * associated with **setup time**

## Inventory Models for Independent Demand
* the objective of most inventory models is to *minimize total costs*
* by minimizing the setup and holding costs, we will minimize total costs
  * all other costs such as the inventory itself are constant

### EOQ Model
* goal of EOQ model is to calculate the **optimal order quantity**
  * will occur where the order-cost curve and the carrying-cost curve intersect
  * or, where the total setup cost = total holding cost
* the steps are:
  1. calculate setup/ordering cost
  2. calculate holding cost
  3. set setup/order cost = holding cost
  4. solve for optimal order quantity
