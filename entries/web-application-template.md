I created a [github repo](https://github.com/rrickgauer/Web-Application-Template) that serves as a template I use for starting many of my php web applications.

All you have to do is [click this link](https://github.com/rrickgauer/Web-Application-Template/archive/master.zip) to download the files. 

## Additional steps

* Add a db-info.php page
* Create a subdirectory called *tables* and run my [tables application](https://github.com/rrickgauer/tables)
