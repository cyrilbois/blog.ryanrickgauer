# Course Roster

I finally got to updating my site [courseroster.com](https://courseroster.com/login.php). It's a site where [NIU](https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml) students can go see what courses their friends signed up for. I wrote the first version of this about a year ago, and I even bought the domain name. However, when I started pledging my fraternity and school started picking up, I kind of forgot about it. Now I've totally revamped it and I can't wait to show my friends and hear any comments they may have about it.

If you have any ideas, comments, or questions, feel free to shoot me an email at rrickgauer1@gmail.com! Thanks and enjoy.
