# Course Roster

I finally got to updating my site courseroster.com. It's a site where NIU students can go see what courses their friends signed up for. I wrote the first version of this about a year ago, and I even bought the domain name. However, when I started pledging my fraternity and school started picking up, I kind of forgot about it. Now I've totally revampped it and I can't wait to show my friends and hear any comments they may have about it.
