For Christmas this year, I decided it was time to build myself a custom PC. I didn't really know what I was doing, but I knew I was going to be writing code on it and occasionally playing [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/). 

It took me about 8 hours and countless youtube videos to get it going. However, once I turned it on for the first time and it worked, I was very proud of myself.
