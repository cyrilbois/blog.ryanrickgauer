This css tip adds a great looking [box shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) to your web components. I always apply this styling to all of my [bootstrap cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/).

All you have to do is add this to your css file:

```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18);
}
```

I got this idea from Steve Schoger's [tweet](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/877209916179709955). This tweet is part a [series of tweets](https://twitter.com/i/events/994601867987619840) that offer some pretty amazing design advice. You should check them out.
